<div class="w-100">
	<p>🏀 I am an AI Engineer in D-Meta who is working with computer vision-related problems using Deep learning frameworks such as Pytorch and Tensorflow. I am looking forward to building more skills and experience in these areas. My current strengths include being able to pick up new AI-related technical skills quickly, communicating with others clearly, being an efficient worker under pressure, and being not afraid to speak out my thoughts. Other than work, I enjoy playing basketball, hanging out with others and traveling around the world.</p>
